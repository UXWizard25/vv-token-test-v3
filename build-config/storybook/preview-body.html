  preview-body.html is kept minimal.

  Theme Switching Architecture:
  - Light/Dark mode: Controlled by storybook-dark-mode addon (sun/moon toggle)
  - Color Brand: Controlled by toolbar globalType → withDesignTokens decorator
  - Content Brand: Controlled by toolbar globalType → withDesignTokens decorator
  - Density: Controlled by toolbar globalType → withDesignTokens decorator

  Channel listeners in preview.ts handle:
  - DARK_MODE_EVENT_NAME → updates data-theme attribute
  - updateGlobals → updates other data attributes for docs pages
